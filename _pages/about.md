I am a postdoc fellow at the Gimchler lab at NYU.
My main research interests include neuroeconomics, experimental economics, and decision-making neuroscience
My work focuses on neural mechanisms of irrational choice, reward encoding and strategic choice.
I completed my PhD at Tel Aviv University, advised by [Dino Levy](https://dinolevylab.tau.ac.il).
